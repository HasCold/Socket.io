The process of upgrading an HTTP connection to a WebSocket connection follows a specific handshake mechanism. Hereâ€™s a step-by-step breakdown with a diagram:

### **Steps for HTTP to WebSocket Upgrade:**
1. **Client Sends an HTTP Request (Upgrade Request)**
   - The client sends an HTTP `GET` request with special headers indicating that it wants to upgrade to WebSockets.
   - Key headers:
     ```
     GET /chat HTTP/1.1
     Host: example.com
     Connection: Upgrade
     Upgrade: websocket
     Sec-WebSocket-Key: random_base64_string
     Sec-WebSocket-Version: 13
     ```

2. **Server Responds with 101 Switching Protocols**
   - If the server supports WebSockets, it responds with an HTTP `101 Switching Protocols` status, confirming the upgrade.
   - Key response headers:
     ```
     HTTP/1.1 101 Switching Protocols
     Upgrade: websocket
     Connection: Upgrade
     Sec-WebSocket-Accept: hashed_value
     ```

3. **Connection Upgraded to WebSocket**
   - Once the handshake is successful, both the client and server start communicating over a persistent WebSocket connection.

|   Client    |                          |   Server    |
+-------------+                          +-------------+
        |                                         |
        | 1. HTTP Request with Upgrade Header     |
        |--------------------------------------->  |
        |                                         |
        | 2. 101 Switching Protocols Response     |
        | <-------------------------------------- |
        |                                         |
        | 3. WebSocket Connection Established    |
        | <===============================>      |
```

Now, the connection is full-duplex, meaning both the client and server can send messages independently.
